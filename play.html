<h2>Winter tale</h2>
<h3>SCENE I. Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.</h3>
<h4>Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS</h4>
<p>
    If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
    the like occasion whereon my services are now on
    foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
    difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
</p>
    <h5 id="camillo">  CAMILLO</h5>
  <p> I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
    means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.</p> 
   
    <h5 id="archidamus">ARCHIDAMUS </h5>
    <p>Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
        justified in our loves; for indeed--</p>
    <h5 id="camillo">CAMILLO </h5>
    <p> Beseech you,--</p>
    <h5 id="archidamus">ARCHIDAMUS </h5>
    <p>Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
        we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
        not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
        that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
        may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
        us.</p>
    <h5 id="camillo">CAMILLO </h5>
    <p>You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.</p> 
    <h5 id="archidamus"> ARCHIDAMUS</h5>
    <p> Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
        and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</p>   
    <h5 id="camillo"> CAMILLO</h5>
    <p>Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
        They were trained together in their childhoods; and
        there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
        which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
        more mature dignities and royal necessities made
        separation of their society, their encounters,
        though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
        with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
        embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
        though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
        embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
        winds. The heavens continue their loves!</p>   
    <h5 id="archidamus">ARCHIDAMUS </h5>
    <p>I think there is not in the world either malice or
        matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
        comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
        gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
        into my note.</p>    
    <h5 id="camillo">CAMILLO </h5>
    <p>I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
        is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
        subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
        crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
        see him a man.</p>
